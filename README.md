# âš¡ Random Firings

A cozy little space where neurons (and I) occasionally misfire on purpose.

This is a collection of:
- ðŸ¤– tiny AI or neuro-inspired code snippets
- ðŸ§  experimental notebooks & thoughts
- ðŸŒ€ playful scripts written for no reason at all

It's not a serious project. It's not supposed to be.  
But it's definitely part of my brain speaking.

ðŸ’› Welcome to the noise between my neurons.
